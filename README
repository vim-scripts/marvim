MARVIM - MAcro Repository for VIM

"Give your most complex macros a name and store it for future recall and use"

Problem statement(s): 
-------------------------------
   * Can not remember those complex VIM macro sequences you use frequently?
   * Wish you could save those macros beyond your immediate session? 
   * Wish you could share your VIM macros with each other?
   * Why not templates as well in the same script?

Features
------------
    * Recording of VIM macros into persistent storage for future use
    * Auto-complete based recursive search and load of stored VIM macros
    * Visually select and save templates into persistent storage
